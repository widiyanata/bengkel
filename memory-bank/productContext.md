# Product Context: Bengkelku Mobile

## 1. Problem Solved
Traditional workshop management often relies on manual record-keeping (paper logs, basic spreadsheets), which can be inefficient, prone to errors, and difficult to track over time. This application aims to digitize and streamline these processes.

## 2. Target Audience Needs
- **Efficiency:** Faster ways to record services, manage inventory, and track customer history.
- **Accuracy:** Reduce errors associated with manual data entry.
- **Accessibility:** Access workshop information easily, potentially from a mobile device.
- **Organization:** Keep track of services, stock levels, purchases, and customer details in one place.

## 3. How It Should Work (High-Level)
- Users should be able to navigate easily between different management sections (Services, Stock, Customers).
- Adding new services, items, or customer records should be straightforward.
- Viewing lists of services, stock, or customers should provide clear, relevant information.
- Recording purchases should update stock levels accordingly (Assumption - needs verification).
- Viewing service details might include customer information and parts used (Assumption - needs verification).

## 4. User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive:** Easy to learn and use, even for non-tech-savvy users.
- **Fast:** Responsive interface with minimal loading times.
- **Clear:** Information presented clearly and concisely.
- **Reliable:** Data should be saved accurately and consistently.
