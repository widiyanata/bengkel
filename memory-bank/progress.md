# Progress: Bengkelku Mobile (Free Version Focus)

## 1. What Works (Implemented Features - Free Version)

### Core Functionality & Setup
- **Project Structure:** Standard Vue/Vite setup.
- **Core Dependencies:** Vue (^3.5.13), Vuetify (^3.8.0-beta.0), Vue Router (^4.5.0), `vite-plugin-pwa` installed and configured.
- **Routing:** Lazy-loaded routes defined for all current views.
- **Layout:** `MainLayout.vue` provides structure (App Bar, Bottom Nav, FAB).
- **Data Storage:** All core data managed via `localStorage.js` using Browser Local Storage. Includes functions for Services, Customers, Vehicles, Stock Items, Purchases, Purchase Cart, Workshop Info, User Profile. Includes sample data initialization.
- **Unique IDs:** String-based unique IDs (`timestamp-random`) generated for items, services, etc. Correct handling implemented in `localStorage.js` (removed `Number()` conversions).
- **Stock Logic:** Stock correctly deducted for service parts, added for finalized purchases. **Stock reversal implemented** for both service deletion and purchase deletion.

### Feature Modules
- **Service Management:**
    - CRUD operations functional (`AddServicePage`, `ServiceListPage`, `ServiceDetailPage`).
    - Allows walk-in customer services.
    - Status tracking (Menunggu, Dalam Pengerjaan, Selesai).
    - Adding predefined/custom Jasa and Parts (from inventory) to services.
    - Cost calculation.
    - Search by license plate (basic implementation).
    - UI improvements implemented (list grouping, filtering, informative cards, detail page layout, input dialogs) as per `memori-agment.md`.
- **Inventory Management (Basic):**
    - CRUD operations functional (`AddItemPage`, `StockPage`).
    - Records purchase/sale prices, minimal stock (`stokMinimal`).
    - Search by name/code.
    - Low stock alert display on `StockPage`.
    - "Beli Stok" button adds items to Purchase Cart (handles missing `hargaBeli`).
    - UI improvements implemented (grid card view, indicators, dialogs, filter/sort, action buttons) as per `memori-agment.md`.
- **Invoice Management:**
    - Creation from completed services and walk-in (`InvoiceListPage`, `InvoiceDetailPage`, `WalkInInvoicePage`).
    - Editing (add/remove items - needs verification against `memori-agment.md` specifics).
    - Print/Download placeholders/basic logic.
    - Payment status tracking.
    - UI improvements implemented (visual cards, badges, filters, detail layout, item differentiation, cost summary, status card, action buttons) as per `memori-agment.md`.
- **Purchase Management:**
    - Purchase Cart workflow (`PurchaseCartPage`) allows adding items (from `StockPage`), editing, finalizing (saves history, updates stock).
    - Purchase History view (`PurchaseHistoryPage`).
- **Customer Management (Partial):**
    - CRUD for Customers and associated Vehicles (`CustomerListPage`, `CustomerDetailPage`, `AddCustomerPage`).
    - Displays service history list on detail page.
- **Settings (Partial):**
    - "Clear All Data" functional (`SettingsPage`).
    - Basic Workshop Info saving/loading (`WorkshopInfoPage`).
    - Basic User Profile saving/loading (`UserProfilePage`).
    - Placeholder pages/navigation for other settings.
- **Reporting (Partial):**
    - Basic page (`ReportingPage`) exists.
    - Displays service summary and stock summary (total items, low stock count).

### UI/UX & PWA
- **Theme & Style:** Custom light theme (Sleek Grey/Charcoal) and Vuetify MD3 blueprint applied.
- **Navigation:** Revised `MainLayout.vue` with updated Bottom Navigation and App Bar profile menu.
- **Compactness:** Applied `density="compact"` and layout adjustments in `StockPage`, `PurchaseCartPage`.
- **Notifications:** Uses `v-snackbar` instead of `alert()`.
- **Validation:** Enhanced form validation rules (required, number formats, price logic, unique item codes, phone numbers) implemented in multiple forms.
- **PWA:**
    - `vite-plugin-pwa` configured (manifest, service worker).
    - `usePwaInstall` composable manages install prompt state.
    - Install buttons displayed conditionally (`MainLayout.vue`, `PwaSettingsPage.vue`).
    - **User needs to provide actual icon/screenshot files.**

## 2. What's Left to Build / Verify (Free Version Scope)

### Core Functionality
- **Customer Management:**
    - Implement robust customer search.
    - Verify service history display is complete and accurate.
- **Reporting (Basic):**
    - Implement remaining reports specified in `memori-agment.md`: Daily revenue, parts usage, completed services list.
    - Enhance existing stock summary (e.g., list low stock items).
- **Settings (Basic):**
    - Implement printer settings placeholder/logic (if feasible client-side).
    - Implement basic data backup (e.g., export JSON from Local Storage).
    - Implement PWA cache clearing mechanism (requires Service Worker interaction).
- **Invoice Editing:** Verify implementation matches `memori-agment.md` requirements (adding parts *only* from inventory, jasa from custom/predefined, validation). Verify service locking on paid invoice.
- **Search:** Implement flexible (LIKE) search for license plates (`ServiceListPage`).

### UI/UX Polish & Refinements
- **Apply UI Preferences:** Systematically review all views/components against the detailed UI preferences in `productContext.md` / `memori-agment.md` and apply necessary styling/layout changes (e.g., Dashboard components, specific card layouts, AppBar/BottomNav features like global search, notification badges, scroll behaviors, FAB context).
- **Loading/Empty/Error States:** Add visual feedback for data loading, empty lists, and error conditions.
- **Responsiveness:** Ensure consistent and usable layout across different mobile screen sizes.
- **Transitions/Animations:** Implement smooth transitions as specified.
- **Contrast & Accessibility:** Double-check color contrast, especially for chips and custom theme elements.

### Technical Debt & Robustness
- **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for `localStorage.js` operations and component interactions. Handle potential `localStorage` quota errors.
- **Validation:** Review and enhance validation logic where needed.
- **Code Quality:** Refactor code for clarity, maintainability, and performance where necessary.
- **Testing:** Implement unit and potentially end-to-end tests.

## 3. Current Status
- **Foundation Laid:** Core architecture, data management (via Local Storage), and basic CRUD for key modules are functional.
- **Significant UI Progress:** Many UI enhancements specified in `memori-agment.md` have been implemented (theme, blueprint, navigation, specific page layouts).
- **Next Focus:** Completing core Free version features (Customer Mgmt, Reporting), comprehensive UI polish based on defined preferences, and improving robustness (error handling, validation).

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers
- **PWA Testing:** Full PWA functionality (install prompt, service worker) requires testing in a production build served over HTTPS.
- **Local Storage Limitations:** Inherent risks of data loss, storage limits, and lack of sync remain.
- **Vuetify Beta:** Potential for bugs or breaking changes in the UI library.
