# Active Context: Bengkelku Mobile (Post-Analysis & Update)

## 1. Current Focus
- Addressing remaining items and known issues identified in `progress.md`.
- Prioritizing the next development task.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Completed full project analysis by reading all Memory Bank files.
- Addressed user feedback regarding Purchase History page accessibility:
    - Verified route and component (`PurchaseHistoryPage.vue`) exist.
    - Added a navigation button to `StockPage.vue` linking to the history page.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect the added button.
- Implemented stock reversal for purchase deletion:
    - Modified `deletePurchase` in `localStorage.js` to subtract item quantities from stock.
    - Updated the confirmation dialog message in `PurchaseHistoryPage.vue`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Implemented stock reversal for service deletion:
    - Modified `deleteService` in `localStorage.js` to add item quantities back to stock.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Replaced `alert()` calls with `v-snackbar` components across multiple views for improved UI feedback.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Created placeholder pages (`UserProfilePage.vue`, `WorkshopInfoPage.vue`, `PwaSettingsPage.vue`) and routes for settings sub-sections. Enabled navigation from `SettingsPage.vue`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Enhanced form validation in several views (`AddItemPage`, `AddServicePage`, `CustomerListPage`, `CustomerDetailPage`, `StockPage`) by adding rules for required fields, number formats, phone numbers, and price consistency.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Implemented basic functionality for the "Informasi Bengkel" settings page (`WorkshopInfoPage.vue`), allowing users to save and load workshop name, address, and phone number via Local Storage.
    - Added `getWorkshopInfo` and `saveWorkshopInfo` to `localStorage.js`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Implemented basic functionality for the "Profil Pengguna" settings page (`UserProfilePage.vue`), allowing users to save and load a display name (`namaTampilan`) via Local Storage.
    - Added `getUserProfile` and `saveUserProfile` to `localStorage.js`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Implemented basic PWA install prompt logic in `PwaSettingsPage.vue`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Created basic Reporting page (`ReportingPage.vue`) showing service summary and added navigation.
- Enhanced Reporting page (`ReportingPage.vue`) to include a stock summary (total items, low stock count).
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Added validation to prevent duplicate item codes in `AddItemPage.vue` and `StockPage.vue`.
    - Added `doesItemCodeExist` helper to `localStorage.js`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Fixed duplicate `itemId` bug during dummy data initialization:
    - Modified `itemId` generation in `addItem` function within `localStorage.js` to use timestamp + random string (`\`${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 9)}\``) ensuring uniqueness.
- Corrected `itemId` handling in `localStorage.js`:
    - Removed incorrect `Number()` conversions for `itemId` in `getItemById`, `updateItem`, `deleteItem`, and `updateItemStock` functions to properly handle the new string-based IDs.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this correction.
- Improved purchase cart item addition from `StockPage.vue`:
    - Modified `goToRecordPurchaseForItem` to pass `null` instead of `0` for `hargaBeli` if the stored item's purchase price is missing or zero.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Configured PWA functionality:
    - Installed `vite-plugin-pwa` dependency.
    - Updated `vite.config.js` to include the plugin, configure manifest details (name, icons, screenshots (narrow & wide), categories, **protocol_handlers**), and set up basic service worker generation (`GenerateSW`).
    - Verified that `PwaSettingsPage.vue` correctly handles the `beforeinstallprompt` event.
    - Confirmed with user that placeholder icon files (`public/icons/icon-192x192.png`, `public/icons/icon-512x512.png`) have been created. **User needs to create actual screenshot files referenced in manifest (e.g., `public/screenshots/screenshot1.png`, `public/screenshots/screenshot2.png`).**
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this setup.
- Refactored PWA install prompt logic:
    - Created `src/composables/usePwaInstall.js` to manage shared PWA install state (`installPrompt`) and logic (`triggerInstallPrompt`).
    - Updated `MainLayout.vue` to use the composable and display a persistent install button in the app bar when available.
    - Updated `PwaSettingsPage.vue` to use the composable, removing local state management for the prompt.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this refactoring.
- Modified `AddServicePage.vue` to allow saving services without selecting/adding a customer (walk-in customer). The `addService` function in `localStorage.js` already handles `null` customer/vehicle IDs correctly.
- **Implemented Custom Theme:** Defined and applied a custom light theme (Sleek Grey/Charcoal: Primary `#37474F`, Secondary `#42A5F5`) in `src/plugins/vuetify.js`.
- **Applied MD3 Blueprint:** Enabled the Vuetify MD3 blueprint in `src/plugins/vuetify.js` to adopt modern Material Design component styles.
- **Revised Navigation:** Modified `MainLayout.vue`:
    - Restored "Laporan" (Reporting) to the bottom navigation.
    - Added a profile icon menu to the App Bar linking to "Profil" (`/pengaturan/profil`) and "Pengaturan Lainnya" (`/pengaturan`).
- **Compact Views:**
    - Refactored `StockPage.vue` to use a compact `v-list` instead of `v-card`s.
    - Applied `density="compact"` to lists, cards, and form fields in `PurchaseCartPage.vue`.
- **Updated Memory Bank:** Integrated information from `memori-agment.md` into all core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`).

## 3. Next Steps (Based on `progress.md` and updated context)
With the Memory Bank updated and recent UI changes applied, the next logical steps involve addressing items from `progress.md` and `productContext.md`:
- **Continue UI/UX Polish:** Systematically review and refine UI components across the application to align with the detailed preferences outlined in `productContext.md` (e.g., specific styles for Dashboard, Stock Page, Invoice Pages, AppBar, Bottom Nav, FAB; ensuring high contrast, smooth transitions, handling nulls gracefully).
- **Enhance Reporting Page:** Implement the remaining basic reporting features mentioned in `productContext.md` and `progress.md`, such as listing low-stock items and providing a purchase history summary on `ReportingPage.vue`.
- **Implement Basic Customer Management:** Complete the basic customer management features (database, service history, search) as outlined in the Free Version scope (`productContext.md`). Currently, `CustomerDetailPage.vue` is open, suggesting this might be a good area to focus on.
- **Error Handling:** Implement more comprehensive error handling, particularly for data operations within `localStorage.js` and related component interactions.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Priority:** Given the open `CustomerDetailPage.vue` tab and the unimplemented state of basic customer management, focusing on **Implementing Basic Customer Management** seems like a logical next step. Alternatively, continuing with **UI/UX Polish** across other views or **Enhancing the Reporting Page** are also viable options based on `progress.md`. Error handling remains an underlying need.
- **Complexity:** Customer management involves UI work (lists, details, forms) and data interaction. UI polish requires careful review and styling adjustments. Reporting involves data aggregation from `localStorage.js`. Error handling requires identifying potential failure points.

*This context reflects the state after updating the Memory Bank based on `memori-agment.md`. The immediate focus could be on completing Customer Management, further UI polish, or enhancing Reporting.*
