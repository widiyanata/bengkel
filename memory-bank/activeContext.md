# Active Context: Bengkelku Mobile (Post-Analysis & Update)

## 1. Current Focus
- Addressing remaining items and known issues identified in `progress.md`.
- Prioritizing the next development task.

## 2. Recent Changes
- Completed full project analysis by reading all Memory Bank files.
- Addressed user feedback regarding Purchase History page accessibility:
    - Verified route and component (`PurchaseHistoryPage.vue`) exist.
    - Added a navigation button to `StockPage.vue` linking to the history page.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect the added button.
- Implemented stock reversal for purchase deletion:
    - Modified `deletePurchase` in `localStorage.js` to subtract item quantities from stock.
    - Updated the confirmation dialog message in `PurchaseHistoryPage.vue`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Implemented stock reversal for service deletion:
    - Modified `deleteService` in `localStorage.js` to add item quantities back to stock.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Replaced `alert()` calls with `v-snackbar` components across multiple views for improved UI feedback.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Created placeholder pages (`UserProfilePage.vue`, `WorkshopInfoPage.vue`, `PwaSettingsPage.vue`) and routes for settings sub-sections. Enabled navigation from `SettingsPage.vue`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Enhanced form validation in several views (`AddItemPage`, `AddServicePage`, `CustomerListPage`, `CustomerDetailPage`, `StockPage`) by adding rules for required fields, number formats, phone numbers, and price consistency.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Implemented basic functionality for the "Informasi Bengkel" settings page (`WorkshopInfoPage.vue`), allowing users to save and load workshop name, address, and phone number via Local Storage.
    - Added `getWorkshopInfo` and `saveWorkshopInfo` to `localStorage.js`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Implemented basic functionality for the "Profil Pengguna" settings page (`UserProfilePage.vue`), allowing users to save and load a display name (`namaTampilan`) via Local Storage.
    - Added `getUserProfile` and `saveUserProfile` to `localStorage.js`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Implemented basic PWA install prompt logic in `PwaSettingsPage.vue`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Created basic Reporting page (`ReportingPage.vue`) showing service summary and added navigation.
- Enhanced Reporting page (`ReportingPage.vue`) to include a stock summary (total items, low stock count).
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Added validation to prevent duplicate item codes in `AddItemPage.vue` and `StockPage.vue`.
    - Added `doesItemCodeExist` helper to `localStorage.js`.
    - Updated `progress.md` to reflect this change.
- Updated this `activeContext.md` file.

## 3. Next Steps (Based on `progress.md`)
With validation improvements including unique item codes completed, the next logical steps involve:
- **Further Enhance Reporting:** Add more detailed reports to `ReportingPage.vue` (e.g., list low stock items, purchase history summary).
- **UI/UX Polish:** Address remaining UI refinements, such as adding loading indicators where needed or improving layout consistency.
- **Error Handling:** Implement more comprehensive error handling for data operations in `localStorage.js` and component interactions.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- **Priority:** Enhancing the **Reporting** page further or focusing on **UI/UX Polish** are good next steps. Error handling is also important but might be addressed incrementally.
- **Complexity:** Adding more reports involves data aggregation. UI polish involves reviewing components. Error handling requires careful consideration of potential failure points.

*This context reflects the state after adding unique item code validation. The focus shifts to enhancing reporting or UI/UX polish.*
